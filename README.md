# Gui-Projects
This repo contains a gui dice roller, where if you click on the dice it changes to a random die face image. 
This repo also contains a changing image file, where if you click on certain aspects of the image they change. 
Lastly, it contains a project called math rush that asks you 10 different math problems to answer. It then gives 
you a score and an option to open a file where your answer and the correct answer are shown.
